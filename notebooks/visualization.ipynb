worrying about boys right now but two days before we started dating he kissed me and i felt bad for not wanting to date him but i kissed him so i didn't want to make it seem like i'm using him. i'm not that type of person. but the thing is i want to keep it from my parents since i can't date until i'm 16. so due to that i'm very stressed out and i'm getting nauseous over it since i want to tell them but the outcome will not be good. so i'm not going to tell them at all it's safe to say i really love this boy because we both skype every night and we have since the end of june maybe early july. i am starting high school with him too. but since we are both so bus we don't see each other so we skype. so basically what i need advice on is how to overcome my nauseous feeling and constant stress that i am getting from the whole thing. i haven't really been able to eat or sleep much either from it. and i am going to be more active in school so i obviously need a lot of sleep and food in my system at all times to avoid future health problems. i have tried so many ways to keep my mind occupied. i've watched youtube videos from famous youtuber a because they are so positive and it makes me happy i talk to my close friend and i talk to my bf as well. but after i talk to him the stress comes back. i've thought that maybe i'm really doing this too soon and i should just wait. but i don't want to break up with him because i feel like he won't understand where i'm coming from and we won't even be friends afterwards. i'm just scared of losing him because it'll be more stress for me. and it's my first year in high school i don't want to fail because of it. idk i'm confused over it all. someone please help asap. i see him tomorrow morning at orientation and it's making me

worrying about boys right now but two days before we started dating he kissed me and i felt bad for not wanting to date him but i kissed him so i didn't want to make it seem like i'm using him. i'm not that type of person. but the thing is i want to keep it from my parents since i can't date until i'm 16. so due to that i'm very stressed out and i'm getting nauseous over it since i want to tell them but the outcome will not be good. so i'm not going to tell them at all it's safe to say i really love this boy because we both skype every night and we have since the end of june maybe early july. i am starting high school with him too. but since we are both so bus we don't see each other so we skype. so basically what i need advice on is how to overcome my nauseous feeling and constant stress that i am getting from the whole thing. i haven't really been able to eat or sleep much either from it. and i am going to be more active in school so i obviously need a lot of sleep and food in my system at all times to avoid future health problems. i have tried so many ways to keep my mind occupied. i've watched youtube videos from famous youtuber a because they are so positive and it makes me happy i talk to my close friend and i talk to my bf as well. but after i talk to him the stress comes back. i've thought that maybe i'm really doing this too soon and i should just wait. but i don't want to break up with him because i feel like he won't understand where i'm coming from and we won't even be friends afterwards. i'm just scared of losing him because it'll be more stress for me. and it's my first year in high school i don't want to fail because of it. idk i'm confused over it all. someone please help asap. i see him tomorrow morning at orientation and it's making me

worrying about boys right now but two days before we started dating he kissed me and i felt bad for not wanting to date him but i kissed him so i didn't want to make it seem like i'm using him. i'm not that type of person. but the thing is i want to keep it from my parents since i can't date until i'm 16. so due to that i'm very stressed out and i'm getting nauseous over it since i want to tell them but the outcome will not be good. so i'm not going to tell them at all it's safe to say i really love this boy because we both skype every night and we have since the end of june maybe early july. i am starting high school with him too. but since we are both so bus we don't see each other so we skype. so basically what i need advice on is how to overcome my nauseous feeling and constant stress that i am getting from the whole thing. i haven't really been able to eat or sleep much either from it. and i am going to be more active in school so i obviously need a lot of sleep and food in my system at all times to avoid future health problems. i have tried so many ways to keep my mind occupied. i've watched youtube videos from famous youtuber a because they are so positive and it makes me happy i talk to my close friend and i talk to my bf as well. but after i talk to him the stress comes back. i've thought that maybe i'm really doing this too soon and i should just wait. but i don't want to break up with him because i feel like he won't understand where i'm coming from and we won't even be friends afterwards. i'm just scared of losing him because it'll be more stress for me. and it's my first year in high school i don't want to fail because of it. idk i'm confused over it all. someone please help asap. i see him tomorrow morning at orientation and it's making me

worrying about boys right now but two days before we started dating he kissed me and i felt bad for not wanting to date him but i kissed him so i didn't want to make it seem like i'm using him. i'm not that type of person. but the thing is i want to keep it from my parents since i can't date until i'm 16. so due to that i'm very stressed out and i'm getting nauseous over it since i want to tell them but the outcome will not be good. so i'm not going to tell them at all it's safe to say i really love this boy because we both skype every night and we have since the end of june maybe early july. i am starting high school with him too. but since we are both so bus we don't see each other so we skype. so basically what i need advice on is how to overcome my nauseous feeling and constant stress that i am getting from the whole thing. i haven't really been able to eat or sleep much either from it. and i am going to be more active in school so i obviously need a lot of sleep and food in my system at all times to avoid future health problems. i have tried so many ways to keep my mind occupied. i've watched youtube videos from famous youtuber a because they are so positive and it makes me happy i talk to my close friend and i talk to my bf as well. but after i talk to him the stress comes back. i've thought that maybe i'm really doing this too soon and i should just wait. but i don't want to break up with him because i feel like he won't understand where i'm coming from and we won't even be friends afterwards. i'm just scared of losing him because it'll be more stress for me. and it's my first year in high school i don't want to fail because of it. idk i'm confused over it all. someone please help asap. i see him tomorrow morning at orientation and it's making me
